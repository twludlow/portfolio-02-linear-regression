Ames Modeling Ideas

- Quality Ratings - adjust to normal distribution to curve results, standardize
- Look for a split in broadly cheaper mat'ls at higher price, and nicer materials at lower price to identify neighborhood areas
- Include 'Value of Misc Feature' with intercept (beta=1)

- Subclass and zoning will have sig. impact

- There will be university homes and non-university homes
- Government areas and non-government areas
- Patterns between materials will broadly indicate quality
- Connections between PID and lot, zone, materials, year?

Neighborhoods - MAPPABLE
- Price inflation over time

Proxy for Garage Year Built
- Going to separate into 3 piece dummy: 
	No garage, 
	older than median time since built, 
	closer than median time since built
