EDA Observations:
- Alley: 'NA' means 'No alley access'. This likely was interpreted as np.nan
- MSSubClass - categories overlap, may have correlations within "sub"-subclasses
- Condition1/Condition2 - same fields, and np.nans may have to be preserved
- BldgType - may eliminate overlap of subclass
- HouseStyle - along with BldgType these may be NaN for commercial/industrial
- YearRemodAdd - may be same as construction date.  This means no remodels or addns
-Exterior2nd - double field, likely has NaNs
-MasonryVeneerType - check 'None' value for auto-inference
-BasementQual - NA means "no basement" - likely interpreted as np.nan
-BasementCond - same as above
-Basement Exposure - check 'No' and 'NA' for np.nan overwrite
-BasementFintype1 - 'NA'
-BasementFinType2 - 'NA', also optional field with lots of actual NAs - need to parse carefully
-CentralAir - easy dummy convert Y/N to 1/0
-2ndFlSqFt - optional field, many nans
-FireplaceQu - NA means 'no fireplace'. Nan status likely valid
-GarageType - NA means 'no garage'
-MANY OPTIONAL CATEGORY COLUMNS
-PoolQC - NA is no pool
-Fence - NA is no fence
-MiscFeature - NA is none
$VALUE OF MISC FEATURE - FREEBIE!

-Subclass, Id, PID type to string (categorical, not numeric)
-Year Built to datetime


Variables
DONE: - Lot Frontage
	Linear feet of street connected to property
	Bad rows removed (had FR listed), then NaNs replaced with 0s

DONE: - Confirmed validity of Fireplace Quality Nans - no Fireplaces > 0 have NaN

DONE: - Mas Vnr Type (Masonry Veneer Type) / Mas Vnr Area (Masonry Veneer Area)
	Replaced with 'None' string
- Add parameters for read_csv on reimport

DONE- Basement Exposure Type - No needs to be consistent with NA.  
		Index 1327 is NaN, and has Nan Vals for multiple Basement cols. Need to reconcile
		WILL KEEP AND FILLNA

DONE: - Basement exposure data Nan: likely should be "No" exposure, but may want to remove
	Indexes 1456, 1547, 1997 REMOVED

DONE - Basement - NA is no basement.  NA should be changed to 0sqft

CONFIRMED Unneeded/DONE: - Basements: Number Basement bathrooms is listed as '0' - should be 0 for units With basements and NA for units without basements.

DONE: - BsmtFin Type 2 - data missing, because SQft 2 has data.
	Index 1147 REMOVED

DONE:- Remaining Values: NaNs should become 'NA'

DONE: - Garage type detached, Yr built is NA: Index 1712.  NAs across garage vals, despite Detached type
	Remove

DONE: Column Names - lowercase, remove spaces (repl w _)

DONE-Data Types
	Years to Datetime - YES
	PID to string - No.  May be numerical connection

JUDGEMENT CALLS
	- Removing Basement Exposure Nans where basements exist (not changing them to 'No', since 'No' values imported correctly.)
	- Garage Year Built - leaving as Nan for now, since no default datetime fits
		- Index 1699 - changing from 2207 to 2007, rather than removing
